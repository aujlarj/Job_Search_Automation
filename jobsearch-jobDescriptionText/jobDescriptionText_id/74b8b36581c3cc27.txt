<div><div><div><b>Our Mission</b></div><div>
We’re here to create a safer, happier and more mindful future for all with the help of data science, engineering, design, and mobile technology.

We're out to change behavior and promote mindful living at a societal level. But the key to us being successful in our mission isn’t just about nailing the technology—it’s about hiring the talented people who can help us make a quantifiable impact in the world. We’re growing our world-class team.</div><div>
